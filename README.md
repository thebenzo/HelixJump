# HelixJump
Welcome to Helix Jump, a fast-paced arcade-style 3D game created using Unity Engine! Guide a bouncing ball as it descends through a rotating tower of platforms. Your goal is to survive as long as possible by strategically rotating the tower and avoiding deadly zones.

# Features
* **3D Arcade Gameplay**: Experience the classic Helix Jump game, with a focus on clean controls, fluid physics, and an endless descent challenge.

* **Procedurally Generated Tower**: The helix platforms are dynamically generated with randomized gaps, creating a new and unique layout each time you restart the game.

* **Physics-Based Bouncing Ball**: Utilizes Unity's built-in physics to create realistic bouncing and falling mechanics. Watch your ball react naturally as it descends through platform gaps.

* **Intuitive Controls**: Drag left or right to rotate the helix structure on mouse input.
